    <h1>Media Queries</h1>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Media queries allow us to make our sites <em>responsive</em>. We can use media queries to apply CSS styling only when certain conditions apply. For instance, our sites can look different depending on the size of the screen, or <em>viewport</em> a user is viewing our content with. We can also change the way our site appears if a user is printing our website, or using a screen-reader! </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Using media queries and responsive design allows us to ensure that our site looks and works great no matter <em>how</em> the user is viewing it.</p> And, as more and more people use more and more devices to browse the internet, integrating media queries into websites is becoming a common, widespread practice!
